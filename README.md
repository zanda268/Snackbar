# Snackbar

A light-weight program designed to handle selling and tracking of items by a definitely AAFES approved snackbar.

To edit settings, add users/inventory, or anything at all really, mouse over File -> Enable Admin Mode and enter the default password "password".

From there, the Admin tab will enable allowing you to change settings as necessary. Most things have tooltips but this was built for personal use so not everything may be user friendly.

Recommended setup is a laptop with a barcode scanner.
User enters their ID, scans the items they want to buy, and then press Shift + Enter or clicks the Purchase button to complete their purchase.

There is a nice little easter egg menu for funny stuff if your office is into that sort of thing. Good luck unlocking it.
